Simple internal mail relay abuse script

Came from being on site once, and having to do it all by hand to multiple recipients. Never again! :)

Takes list of target email addresses, text file with mail body
and source email address. Best used with SET and trojan'd login page

What is doesn't do: Can only use text files as message body. Plan is to get it to read .msg files too, so that nicely formatted outlook messages can be sent (should you so desire).
