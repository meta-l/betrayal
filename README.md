# betrayal
Simple internal mail relay abuse script

Takes list of target email addresses, text file with mail body
and source email address. Best used with SET and trojan'd login page

What is doesn't do: Can on use text files as message body. Plan is to get it to read .msg files too, so that nicely formatted outlook messages can be sent.
